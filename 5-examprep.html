            <strong>Analogy - EW/CW Lenses like High-Altitude Mountaineering:</strong>
            "Daily wear lenses are like hiking in local hills â€“ generally safe with basic precautions. EW/CW lenses are like attempting Everest:
            <ul>
                <li>You need <span class="keywords"><span>specialized gear</span></span> (High Dk/t SiHy).</li>
                <li>Only <span class="keywords"><span>extremely fit, experienced, and well-prepared climbers</span></span> (patients) should attempt it.</li>
                <li>The <span class="keywords"><span>risks are much higher</span></span>, and bad things can happen quickly (MK).</li>

            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> EW/CW offers convenience but demands extremely careful patient selection, the highest Dk/t SiHy lenses, impeccable (though reduced) hygiene if lenses are reused, and intensive monitoring due to significantly increased risks of serious complications like MK.

            <summary class="self-check-summary-detailed">Self-Check: A patient asks if they can just "nap for an hour or two" in their regular daily wear hydrogel lenses. What is your advice and why?</summary>
            <p>The advice should generally be <span class="keywords"><span>NO, unless those specific lenses are FDA-approved for napping/overnight wear (which standard hydrogels rarely are)</span></span>.
            <strong>Why:</strong> Even short naps with eyes closed in lenses not designed for it drastically reduce oxygen to the cornea (closed eye + lens barrier). Standard hydrogels typically have insufficient Dk/t for safe closed-eye wear. This increases the risk of acute hypoxia, corneal edema (Sattler's veil, spectacle blur upon waking), and potentially inflammatory events like CLARE, especially if the lens fit is also tight. It's better to remove lenses even for short naps unless they are specifically approved for extended wear and the patient is managed for it.</p>

            <strong>Analogy - Inflammatory Reactions like an Overzealous Security System:</strong>
            "Your eye's 'security system' (immune response) can sometimes overreact:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GPC:</strong> Like developing an allergy to the 'dust bunnies' (deposits) on your old CLs, making your inner eyelid 'rough and bumpy.'</li>
                <li><strong>CLARE:</strong> Waking up with a red, angry eye because 'bacterial fumes' (toxins) got trapped under your 'overnight face mask' (lens).</li>
                <li><strong>Sterile Infiltrates:</strong> 'Security guards' (WBCs) rushing to a spot where they *think* there's a problem (due to toxins/irritation), even if there's no actual 'burglar' (infection).</li>
                <li><strong>CLPU:</strong> A small 'pothole' (ulcer) forms at the edge of the 'road' (cornea) due to a strong reaction to nearby 'bacterial litter.'</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="mini-summary">
            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Inflammatory/allergic CL complications are common and are primarily the body's response to stimuli like deposits, toxins, or mechanical irritation. Management involves removing the trigger, reducing inflammation, and addressing underlying causes. Differentiating sterile from infectious processes is key.

            <summary class="self-check-summary-detailed">Self-Check: A patient presents with a single, small, peripheral white spot on the cornea with intact epithelium above it and mild discomfort. What is this most likely to be, and how does it differ from Microbial Keratitis?</summary>
            <p>This is most likely a <span class="keywords"><span>Sterile Infiltrate (Infiltrative Keratitis - IK)</span></span>.
            It differs from Microbial Keratitis (MK) in several key ways:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Epithelial Defect:</strong> Sterile infiltrates usually have an intact or minimally stained overlying epithelium, whereas MK typically has a significant epithelial defect (ulceration) that stains brightly with fluorescein.</li>
                <li><strong>Pain:</strong> Pain with sterile infiltrates is usually mild to moderate, while MK often causes severe pain.</li>
                <li><strong>Location/Size:</strong> Sterile infiltrates are often smaller, more peripheral, and may be multiple. MK can be central or peripheral, often larger and can progress rapidly.</li>
                <li><strong>Discharge:</strong> Significant purulent discharge is more characteristic of MK.</li>
                <li><strong>Anterior Chamber Reaction:</strong> A significant AC reaction (cells/flare, hypopyon) is more common and severe in MK.</li>
            </ol>
            However, early MK can sometimes mimic a sterile infiltrate, so caution and often prophylactic antibiotics are used if there's any doubt.
