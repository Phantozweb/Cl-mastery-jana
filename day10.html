            <h2>Step 37: Disposable Contact Lenses</h2>
            <p>Lenses designed to be discarded after a single use or a short period.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Daily Disposable (DD) / Single Use Lenses:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Worn for one day and then discarded. A fresh, sterile lens is used each day.</li>
                        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="cl-relevance">Highest level of hygiene:</span> Eliminates risks associated with lens cleaning, disinfection, and case contamination.</li>
                                <li><span class="cl-relevance">Ultimate convenience:</span> No solutions or cleaning required.</li>
                                <li><span class="cl-relevance">Reduced risk of deposit-related complications</span> (like GPC) and solution sensitivities.</li>
                                <li>Ideal for occasional wear, sports, allergies, patients with poor compliance with care regimens, or those prone to deposits.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Often made from comfortable, high-water content hydrogels or modern SiHys.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="analogy">
                <strong>Analogy - Daily Disposables:</strong> Like using a fresh paper plate for every meal. No washing up, always clean and hygienic.
            </div>

            <h2>Step 38: Frequent Replacement (FR) Lenses</h2>
            <p>Lenses replaced on a planned schedule, more frequently than "conventional" (traditionally annual replacement) lenses. This category includes lenses replaced 2-weekly or monthly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modalities:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="key-term">2-Weekly Replacement:</span> Discarded after up to 14 days of wear.</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Monthly Replacement:</span> Discarded after up to 30 days of wear.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Benefits over Conventional Lenses:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="cl-relevance">Reduced accumulation of deposits</span> and denatured proteins over the lens lifespan.</li>
                        <li>Better lens performance (comfort, vision, wettability) throughout the wearing cycle.</li>
                        <li>Generally lower risk of complications compared to very long replacement schedules.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Requires a full lens care regimen</span> (cleaning, rinsing, disinfecting, proper case care) as lenses are reused.</li>
                <li>Most modern soft lenses (spherical, toric, multifocal) are available in FR modalities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 39: Complications of Contact Lenses – Part 1 (Inflammatory & Allergic)</h2>
            <p>These conditions are primarily driven by the body's immune/inflammatory response, often triggered by lens deposits, mechanical irritation, solution sensitivity, or bacterial toxins (even without active infection).</p>
            <div class="mnemonic">
                <strong>Patient Symptom Alert: RSVP!</strong> If patient reports: <strong>R</strong>edness, <strong>S</strong>ensitivity (to light), <strong>V</strong>ision change, <strong>P</strong>ain -> Lenses out, see ECP ASAP!

            <div class="complication-box">
                <h4>Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC) / Contact Lens Papillary Conjunctivitis (CLPC)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Itching (especially after lens removal), mucous discharge, lens intolerance/movement, blurred vision. <span class="key-term">Large papillae (>0.3mm, often >1mm "giant")</span> on upper tarsal conjunctiva (seen on lid eversion). Conjunctival redness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Allergic/inflammatory reaction to denatured protein deposits on lens surface, mechanical irritation from lens edge or deposits, solution components. More common with soft lenses, longer replacement schedules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Discontinue CL wear temporarily. Replace lenses frequently (DDs ideal). Change lens material/design. Prescribe topical mast cell stabilizers/antihistamines, sometimes short course of steroids. Improve lens hygiene.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="complication-box">
                <h4>Contact Lens Acute Red Eye (CLARE)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Acute onset of unilateral red eye, often upon waking after overnight lens wear (even if approved EW). Mild pain/discomfort, light sensitivity, tearing. Corneal infiltrates may be present but no epithelial defect usually.</li>
                    <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Inflammatory reaction to bacterial endotoxins trapped under a (usually tight-fitting) lens, often associated with sleeping in lenses. Hypoxia can be a factor. Not an active infection itself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Discontinue CL wear. Usually resolves spontaneously in days/weeks. Consider refitting with looser lens or higher Dk/t material. Prophylactic antibiotic sometimes given if infiltrates are significant. Educate on risks of overnight wear.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="complication-box">
                <h4>Infiltrative Keratitis (IK) / Sterile Infiltrates</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Focal, whitish, hazy opacity (infiltrate - accumulation of white blood cells) in anterior corneal stroma, often peripheral or mid-peripheral. Overlying epithelium usually intact (no fluorescein staining or minimal punctate staining). Mild to moderate pain, redness, light sensitivity. Can be single or multiple.</li>
                    <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Inflammatory response to bacterial toxins, lens deposits, solution sensitivity, tight lens syndrome, hypoxia, poor hygiene. <span class="key-term">Distinguish from Microbial Keratitis (MK) which has an epithelial defect and more severe pain.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Discontinue CL wear. Topical antibiotics often prescribed prophylactically or if unsure if sterile. Topical steroids may be used cautiously once infection is ruled out to reduce inflammation and scarring. Address underlying cause (e.g., improve hygiene, change lens/solution).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="complication-box">
                <h4>Contact Lens Peripheral Ulcer (CLPU) / Sterile Peripheral Ulcer</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Small (<1-2mm), round, peripheral corneal infiltrate with an overlying <span class="key-term">epithelial defect (stains with fluorescein)</span>. Moderate pain, redness, light sensitivity. Often associated with gram-positive bacteria (Staph species) toxins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Hypersensitivity/inflammatory reaction to bacterial exotoxins, often from blepharitis or contaminated lens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Discontinue CL wear. Usually self-limiting but often treated with topical antibiotics to prevent secondary infection and cover for early MK. Manage any underlying blepharitis. Scarring is common but usually peripheral and not visually significant.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 40: Complications of Contact Lenses – Part 2 (Infectious & Hypoxic)</h2>
            <p>These are often more serious and can be sight-threatening.</p>

            <div class="complication-box">
                <h4><span class="key-term">Microbial Keratitis (MK) / Infective Corneal Ulcer</span> <span class="critical-warning">SIGHT-THREATENING EMERGENCY!</span></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Signs:</strong> <span class="key-term">Severe pain</span> (often out of proportion), significant redness (ciliary flush), blurred vision, light sensitivity, discharge (often purulent). Corneal infiltrate with an overlying <span class="key-term">epithelial defect</span>. Anterior chamber reaction (cells/flare, hypopyon) common. Reduced VA.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Factors:</strong> <span class="key-term">Overnight wear (highest risk!)</span>, poor hygiene, topping off solutions, tap water exposure, smoking, contaminated cases/lenses, extended wear beyond schedule.</li>
                    <li><strong>Common Pathogens:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="key-term">Pseudomonas aeruginosa:</span> Very aggressive, rapid progression, common in soft CL wearers.</li>
                            <li>Staphylococcus, Streptococcus species.</li>
                            <li>Fungi (e.g., Fusarium, Aspergillus) - often after trauma with organic matter, slower onset.</li>
                            <li><span class="key-term">Acanthamoeba:</span> Protozoan. Associated with tap water exposure, poor disinfection. <span class="key-term">Severe pain often a hallmark</span>, ring infiltrate (late sign). Difficult to treat.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> <span class="key-term">IMMEDIATE DISCONTINUATION OF CL WEAR.</span> Urgent referral to ophthalmologist/corneal specialist. Corneal scrape for cultures and sensitivities. Intensive topical fortified antibiotics (often hourly initially). Cycloplegics for pain/uveitis. Possible hospital admission. May require surgical intervention if severe. Permanent scarring and vision loss common if not treated aggressively.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="complication-box">
                <h4>Corneal Neovascularization (NV)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Growth of new blood vessels from the limbus into the normally avascular cornea. Can be superficial or deep. Usually asymptomatic until advanced or associated with lipid keratopathy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Chronic corneal hypoxia (most common CL-related cause, especially with older low Dk/t lenses, tight fits, or overwear), chronic inflammation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Indicates chronic stress. Vessels can leak lipids (lipid keratopathy) causing opacification. Can compromise corneal graft survival. If vessels reach visual axis, vision is affected. <span class="cl-relevance">Aim for <1-1.5mm of vessel growth, or no growth.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Improve oxygen supply (refit with higher Dk/t SiHy lens, reduce wear time, improve fit). Treat underlying inflammation. If severe, may need to discontinue CL wear.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Hazy/cloudy cornea, Sattler's veil (patient reports halos/haze), spectacle blur after lens removal. Slit lamp: Stromal haze, vertical striae (posterior stroma), endothelial folds (Descemet's), epithelial microcysts (small, refractile dots - chronic hypoxia).</li>
                    <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Hypoxia (most common CL cause, from low Dk/t, tight fit, overwear), endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, high IOP.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Improve oxygen (higher Dk/t SiHy, looser fit, reduce wear time). Address underlying cause.</li>

                <h4>Corneal Warpage / CL-Induced Corneal Distortion</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Signs:</strong> Changes in corneal curvature (seen on topography/keratometry), spectacle blur (vision better with CLs than new glasses), changes in refractive error. Mires may be distorted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Causes:</strong> Long-term wear of poorly fitting RGPs (often flat-fitting PMMA or low Dk RGP) or sometimes tight-fitting soft lenses, leading to corneal molding.</li>
                    <li><strong>Management:</strong> Discontinue CL wear for a period (can take weeks/months for cornea to stabilize). Refit with better-fitting lens once stable. Topography is essential for monitoring.</li>

                <strong>Study Tip - Complication Comparison:</strong> Create a table comparing Sterile Infiltrate vs. CLPU vs. Microbial Keratitis. Columns: Key Symptoms, Epithelial Defect (Y/N), Pain Level, Typical Location, Management Urgency. This will help differentiate them.

        <h3>Day 10 Summary (Fill this in after your study session!)</h3>
        <p><em>Today covered lens replacement schedules and the critical topic of CL complications. Daily disposables offer maximum hygiene, while frequent replacement (2-weekly/monthly) reduces deposit buildup compared to older conventional lenses. Inflammatory/allergic issues include GPC (papillae on upper lid), CLARE (acute red eye post-sleep), sterile infiltrates (no epi defect), and CLPU (peripheral ulcer with epi defect). Infectious/hypoxic complications are more severe: Microbial Keratitis is a sight-threatening emergency (severe pain, epi defect, discharge), while chronic hypoxia can cause neovascularization and edema. The RSVP rule is vital for patients to report... Differentiating a sterile infiltrate from MK relies on factors like...</em></p>
