If the clear hole (<span class="keywords"><span>optic zone</span></span>) is too small or doesn't stay centered over your pupil, you'll be looking through the colored part, and your vision will be weird or blocked.

            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Cosmetic CLs must be fitted by an ECP like any other medical device to ensure proper fit, adequate pupil coverage, and minimize risks. Patient education on risks of non-prescribed lenses is vital.

                    <li><span class="keywords"><span>Dynamic Stabilization (Thin Zones / Double Slab-Off):</span></span> Thinner zones at superior and inferior lens portions, thicker horizontally. Lid pressure during blinks orients and stabilizes. Very common.</li>

                    <li>Check <span class="keywords"><span>orientation markings</span></span> (lines/dots, usually at 3, 6, 9 o'clock or just 6). Note rotation amount & direction (from ECP's view). Ideal: stable, â‰¤5-10Â°.</li>

            <strong>Analogy - Toric CLs like Keys for Special Locks:</strong>
            "If your eye's 'lock' (astigmatism) is a simple round hole, a spherical 'key' (CL) works. If the lock is a special shape (oval/astigmatic), you need a specially shaped 'toric key.'
            <ul>
                <li><span class="keywords"><span>Soft Torics:</span></span> Are like slightly weighted keys that try to always fall into the lock the right way up (<span class="keywords"><span>stabilization</span></span>).</li>

                        <li>FST: Key is round on the inside, specially shaped on the outside.</li>
                        <li>BST: Key is specially shaped on the inside to fit the lock, round outside.</li>
                        <li>Bitoric: Key is specially shaped on both inside AND outside for the trickiest locks!</li>

            <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Toric CLs are essential for correcting significant astigmatism. Soft torics rely on stabilization mechanisms, while RGP torics use different surface toricities to manage corneal and internal astigmatism for optimal fit and vision.

            <p>A <span class="keywords"><span>Back Surface Toric (BST) RGP</span></span> or a <span class="keywords"><span>Bitoric (BiT) RGP</span></span> would be considered.
            <ul>
                <li>A BST RGP would align well with the 3.00D toric cornea, improving stability. The tear lens with a spherical front surface would correct much of the corneal astigmatism. The remaining 0.50D of internal astigmatism might be acceptable, or if not, a Bitoric lens would be needed.</li>
                <li>A Bitoric RGP would be the most precise, allowing the back surface to perfectly align with the 3.00D corneal toricity and the front surface to independently correct the total refractive astigmatism (corneal + internal). Given the high corneal toricity, this is often the preferred approach for optimal stability and vision.</li>
            </ul>
            A spherical RGP would likely rock excessively or decenter on such a toric cornea.
