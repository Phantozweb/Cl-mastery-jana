            <div class="important-warning">
                <strong>Advanced Applications Require Expertise & Caution!</strong> These lens types often involve patients with more complex needs or higher risks. Thorough understanding and careful management are key.
            </div>

            <h2>Step 33: Bifocal and Multifocal Contact Lenses</h2>
            <p>Designed to correct <span class="key-term">presbyopia</span>, allowing clear vision at both distance and near (and sometimes intermediate).</p>
            <h3>Key Design Principles:</h3>
            <div class="lens-design-highlight">
            Most soft multifocal lenses work on the principle of <span class="key-term">Simultaneous Vision</span>: different portions of the lens optic provide different powers, and the brain learns to select the image that is in focus for the desired viewing distance.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simultaneous Vision Designs (Common in Soft Lenses, some RGPs):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Aspheric Designs:</span> Gradually changing power from center to periphery. Can be center-near (CN - plus power centrally, distance peripherally) or center-distance (CD). Pupil size influences which part of the lens is used.</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Concentric (Annular) Designs:</span> Alternating rings of distance and near power. Can be CN or CD.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Translating (Alternating Vision) Designs (Mainly RGPs):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lens has distinct distance (upper) and near (lower) zones, similar to bifocal spectacles.</li>
                        <li>Lens <span class="key-term">must move (translate) upwards</span> when the patient looks down to read, so the pupil is positioned over the near portion.</li>
                        <li>Requires prism ballast and often truncation for proper orientation and translation. Dependent on lower lid position and interaction.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Patient Selection & Fitting:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motivation is Key:</strong> Patients must be highly motivated to adapt to potential visual compromises.</li>
                <li><strong>Realistic Expectations:</strong> Vision may not be as "perfect" as with single vision correction at all distances. Some glare, halos, or "ghosting" can occur, especially initially.</li>
                <li><strong>Refractive Error:</strong> Consider amount of astigmatism (toric multifocals are available). Dominant eye assessment often important for fitting.</li>
                <li><strong>Pupil Size:</strong> Affects performance of simultaneous vision designs.</li>
                <li><strong>Fitting Process:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Follow manufacturer's fitting guide closely.</li>
                        <li>Assess centration and movement (critical for translating designs).</li>
                        <li>Visual assessment: Check VA at distance, intermediate, and near in real-world conditions (good lighting).</li>
                        <li>Allow adaptation time. Multiple trial lens changes may be needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Alternative: Monovision:</strong> One eye corrected for distance, the other for near with single vision lenses. Can be effective but compromises binocularity and depth perception.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="analogy">
                <strong>Analogy - Simultaneous Vision Multifocals:</strong> Like listening to two radio stations at once at low volume. Your brain learns to "tune in" to the station (distance or near image) it wants to focus on and "tune out" the other.
            </div>

            <h2>Step 34: Continuous Wear (CW) and Extended Wear (EW) Lenses</h2>
            <p>Lenses approved for overnight wear.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Extended Wear (EW):</span> Typically approved for up to 6 consecutive nights / 7 days of wear, followed by at least one night of no lens wear.</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Continuous Wear (CW):</span> Approved for up to 30 consecutive nights / days of wear (less common now, higher risk).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="important-warning">
                <strong>EW/CW carries a SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RISK of serious complications, especially Microbial Keratitis (MK).</strong> Patient selection and compliance are paramount.
            </div>
            <h3>Key Requirements & Considerations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lens Material: <span class="key-term">High Dk/t Silicone Hydrogels (SiHy) ONLY.</span></strong> Essential to minimize corneal hypoxia during closed-eye wear. Minimum Dk/t often cited is ~87 for EW, higher for CW (~125).</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Selection (VERY STRICT):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Excellent ocular health (no pre-existing conditions like dry eye, blepharitis).</li>
                        <li>Proven excellent compliance with daily wear hygiene and handling.</li>
                        <li>Low-risk lifestyle and environment (e.g., not a smoker, not in dusty environments).</li>
                        <li>Strong need or desire for overnight wear (e.g., certain occupations).</li>
                        <li>Patient understands and accepts the increased risks. Signed informed consent often used.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fitting:</strong> Fit should be optimal to ensure good tear exchange and minimize mechanical stress.</li>
                <li><strong>Care Regimen:</strong> Even if worn for multiple days, lenses must be cleaned and disinfected upon removal according to manufacturer instructions if they are to be reinserted (not applicable for 30-day CW if lens is discarded after).</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Intensive Follow-up Schedule:</span> More frequent follow-ups are critical, especially in the initial period (e.g., next morning after first overnight wear, 1 week, 1 month). Look for early signs of complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient Education:</strong> Emphasize immediate lens removal and consultation if any pain, redness, discharge, or blurred vision occurs ("Redness, Sensitivity, Vision change, Pain - RSVP").</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 35: Therapeutic Lenses / Bandage Contact Lenses (BCLs)</h2>
            <p>Contact lenses used for medical purposes rather than purely refractive correction.</p>
            <h3>Primary Goals of BCL Use:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pain Relief:</strong> Protects exposed corneal nerves from eyelid blinking (e.g., in abrasions, bullous keratopathy).</li>
                <li><strong>Promote Corneal Healing:</strong> Provides a moist environment, protects migrating epithelial cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Mechanical Protection:</strong> Shields cornea from external trauma or trichiasis (in-turned lashes).</li>
                <li>Maintain Corneal Hydration / Prevent Desiccation.</li>
                <li>Sometimes used for drug delivery (though specialized drug-eluting lenses are emerging).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Common Indications:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Corneal Abrasions / Erosions (Recurrent Corneal Erosion - RCE)</li>
                <li>Bullous Keratopathy (epithelial blisters due to endothelial dysfunction)</li>
                <li>Post-operative healing (e.g., after PRK, corneal transplant, cross-linking)</li>
                <li>Filamentary Keratitis</li>
                <li>Chemical Burns (after initial irrigation)</li>
                <li>Severe Dry Eye (Sjogren's, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) - often scleral lenses for this.</li>
                <li>Corneal Perforations (small, as a temporary seal - "corneal glue assist")</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Lens Selection & Fitting:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Material: <span class="key-term">High Dk/t Silicone Hydrogel soft lenses</span></strong> are preferred to maximize oxygen to the compromised cornea.</li>
                <li><strong>Parameters:</strong> Often larger diameter for stability and full coverage. Plano power or low plus/minus if no refractive need. May need steeper BC for better adherence on irregular surfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Fit:</strong> Should provide good coverage, be relatively immobile (to avoid dislodging or further irritating the cornea), but not so tight as to restrict oxygen or trap debris.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Management & Co-management:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>BCLs are often worn on an <span class="key-term">extended wear basis</span>.</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Prophylactic topical antibiotics</span> are frequently prescribed concurrently to prevent infection, as the BCL can create a favorable environment for microbial growth on a compromised cornea.</li>
                <li>May also use topical NSAIDs for pain/inflammation or cycloplegics for uveitic reaction.</li>
                <li>Close monitoring is essential. Frequent follow-ups to assess healing, check for signs of infection or complications (e.g., CLARE, infiltrates).</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="study-tip">
                <strong>Study Tip - BCL Indications:</strong> For each indication, think about *why* a BCL would be beneficial. What specific goal (pain relief, healing, protection) is being addressed?
            </div>

            <h2>Step 36: Contact Lens Fitting Following Ocular Surgeries</h2>
            <p>Fitting CLs after surgery requires understanding the altered corneal anatomy and physiology.</p>
            <h3>1. Post-Keratoplasty (Corneal Transplant - PKP, DALK, DSAEK/DMEK):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenges:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="key-term">High Irregular Astigmatism:</span> Very common due to graft-host junction, sutures.</li>
                        <li>High Refractive Error (myopia, hyperopia).</li>
                        <li>Graft stability, risk of rejection or suture issues.</li>
                        <li>Fragile epithelium, potential for neovascularization.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Lens Options:</strong>

                <p><strong>Post-Surgical Scenario:</strong> A patient had myopic LASIK 5 years ago and now has developed post-LASIK ectasia with significant irregular astigmatism. Spectacles provide poor vision. Which type of contact lens would likely provide the best visual outcome?</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Answer & Rationale</summary>
                    <p>For post-LASIK ectasia with significant irregular astigmatism, the best visual outcomes are typically achieved with:
                        <ol>
                            <li><span class="key-term">Scleral Lenses:</span> These vault completely over the irregular and potentially fragile cornea, creating a smooth new optical surface with the tear reservoir. They offer excellent stability, comfort (once adapted), and can correct high amounts of irregularity.</li>
                            <li><span class="key-term">Specialty RGP Lenses:</span> Large diameter RGPs or reverse geometry designs might be used. However, achieving a stable fit on an ectatic oblate cornea can be challenging, and comfort can be an issue.</li>
                            <li>Hybrid lenses could also be considered.</li>
                        </ol>
                        Soft lenses (even custom toric) are unlikely to provide optimal vision due to the high degree of *irregularity*.

        <h3>Day 9 Summary (Fill this in after your study session!)</h3>
        <p><em>Today covered advanced CL applications. Multifocal CLs (simultaneous vision or translating) address presbyopia but require managing patient expectations. EW/CW lenses (High Dk SiHy only) offer convenience but carry high risks like MK, needing strict patient selection. Therapeutic BCLs (High Dk SiHy) aid corneal healing and pain relief, often with prophylactic antibiotics. Post-surgical fitting is complex: post-keratoplasty often needs RGPs or sclerals for irregular astigmatism, while post-refractive surgery CLs address residual errors or ectasia, sometimes needing reverse geometry RGPs for oblate corneas. For example, a key feature of a translating RGP bifocal is... The main risk associated with EW is... A BCL for a corneal abrasion primarily functions to...</em></p>
