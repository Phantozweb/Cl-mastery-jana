            <h2>Step 25: Fitting in Keratoconus (Introduction)</h2>
            <p><span class="key-term">Keratoconus (KC)</span> is a progressive, non-inflammatory eye condition where the normally round cornea thins and begins to bulge outward into a cone-like shape. This cone shape causes significant irregular astigmatism and blurred vision.</p>
            <h3>Key Features of Keratoconus:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Blurred/distorted vision (often not fully correctable with glasses), glare, halos, light sensitivity, monocular diplopia (double vision in one eye).</li>
                <li><strong>Clinical Signs (Slit Lamp & Retinoscopy):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Vogt's Striae:</span> Fine vertical stress lines in deep stroma/Descemet's.</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Fleischer's Ring:</span> Iron (hemosiderin) deposition in basal epithelium around the base of the cone (best seen with cobalt blue).</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Munson's Sign:</span> V-shaped indentation of the lower lid on downgaze (caused by the cone).</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Rizzuti's Sign:</span> Conical reflection on nasal limbus when light shone from temporal side.</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Scissoring Reflex</span> on retinoscopy.</li>
                        <li>Corneal thinning (especially at apex of cone).</li>
                        <li>Apical scarring (in advanced cases).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Topography:</strong> Characteristic inferior steepening, high Kmax, skewed radial axes, increased astigmatism. Crucial for diagnosis and monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why Contact Lenses (Especially RGPs) for KC?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spectacles often cannot provide adequate vision due to the high degree of irregular astigmatism.</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">RGP lenses</span> vault over the irregular cornea, and the tear lens fills in the irregularities, creating a smooth, regular anterior refracting surface. This provides significantly better visual acuity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Basic RGP Fitting Goals in Keratoconus:</h3>
            <div class="kc-fitting-goal">
            The goal is to achieve stable lens position, good comfort, and optimal vision while minimizing mechanical stress on the fragile cone.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Three-Point Touch (Classic Approach for mild-moderate KC):</strong> Light touch at the apex of the cone, and alignment/bearing in two opposing mid-peripheral areas. Aims to distribute lens weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Apical Clearance / Vaulting the Cone (Modern Approach, especially for moderate-advanced KC):</strong> Design the lens to completely clear/vault over the corneal apex, with landing zones in the healthier mid-periphery/periphery. Minimizes risk of apical scarring.</li>
                <li>Adequate peripheral clearance for tear exchange.</li>
                <li>Good centration (often challenging).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Lens Options for KC (Briefly):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Specialty Keratoconic RGP Designs:</strong> Multi-curve designs, aspheric, reverse geometry.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Lenses:</strong> RGP center for optics, soft peripheral skirt for comfort and stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Scleral Lenses:</strong> Large diameter lenses that vault entirely over the cornea and limbus, resting on the sclera. Excellent for advanced KC, severe irregularity, or dry eye.</li>
                <li>Piggybacking: Soft lens worn under an RGP for comfort.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="study-tip">
                <strong>Study Tip - Visualize KC Topography:</strong> Look at sample KC topography maps. Try to identify the characteristic inferior steepening and how an RGP lens might need to be designed to fit over that shape.
            </div>

            <h2>Step 26: Lens Care & Hygiene Instructions</h2>
            <div class="critical-point">
                <strong>This is NON-NEGOTIABLE for patient safety.</strong> Improper care is a leading cause of serious eye infections and complications.
            </div>
            <h3>Core Principles for ALL Lens Types:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="key-term">HAND WASHING:</span> Thoroughly wash hands with soap and water, and dry with a lint-free towel <span class="key-term">BEFORE</span> every lens handling instance (insertion, removal, cleaning). This is the single most important step.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow Manufacturer's Instructions & ECP's Advice:</strong> For lenses AND solutions.</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">NEVER Use Tap Water</span> (or saliva, distilled water, homemade solutions) on lenses or lens cases. Risk of Acanthamoeba keratitis.</li>
                <li><strong>Lens Case Care:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rinse with fresh disinfecting solution (NOT water) after each use.</li>
                        <li>Wipe dry with a tissue or air dry upside down with caps off.</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Replace lens case regularly</span> (e.g., every 1-3 months, or as recommended). Cases are a major source of contamination.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Don't "Top Off" Solution:</strong> Always discard old solution from the case and use fresh disinfecting solution each time lenses are stored.</li>
                <li><strong>Replace Lenses as Prescribed:</strong> Don't overwear daily, 2-weekly, or monthly disposable lenses.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Step 27: Patient Compliance</h2>
            <p><span class="key-term">Compliance</span> refers to the extent to which a patient follows the prescribed lens wear schedule, hygiene practices, and follow-up appointments.</p>
            <h3>Why is Non-Compliance Common?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Forgetting instructions / Misunderstanding.</li>
                <li>Perceived inconvenience or time-consuming.</li>
                <li>Cost of solutions or replacement lenses.</li>
                <li>Belief that "shortcuts" are harmless (e.g., topping off solution, using tap water).</li>
                <li>Lack of immediate negative consequences (until a problem occurs).</li>
                <li>Comfort with lenses leading to complacency.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Consequences of Non-Compliance:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Microbial Keratitis (MK):</span> Severe, potentially sight-threatening corneal infection. Risk dramatically increases with poor hygiene, overnight wear of unapproved lenses, and not replacing lenses/cases.</li>
                <li>Other infections and inflammatory events (e.g., CLARE, infiltrates).</li>
                <li>Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC).</li>
                <li>Corneal hypoxia complications.</li>
                <li>Discomfort, reduced wear time, lens intolerance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strategies to Improve Compliance:</h3>

            <h2>Step 28: Follow-up Post Fitting Examination (General Protocol)</h2>
            <p>Regular follow-ups are essential to monitor ocular health, lens performance, and reinforce compliance.</p>
            <h3>Typical Follow-up Schedule (can vary):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial Follow-up: ~1-2 weeks after dispensing.</li>
                <li>Subsequent: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months.</li>
                <li>Routine: Every 6-12 months for established wearers (or as clinically indicated).</li>
            </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Average Wearing Time (AWT) per day? Days per week?</li>
                        <li>Comfort (end-of-day comfort? dryness? grittiness?).</li>
                        <li>Vision (clear? stable? fluctuating? glare/halos?).</li>
                        <li>Lens Care Habits (review compliance - ask, don't assume!).</li>
                        <li>Any problems or concerns? Redness, pain, discharge?</li>

                <strong>Study Tip - Role Play:</strong> Imagine you are the ECP. What questions would you ask a patient at their 1-month soft lens follow-up? What specific things would you look for on the slit lamp?
            </div>
            <div class="interactive-question">
                <p><strong>Follow-up Scenario:</strong> A monthly soft lens wearer comes for their annual check. They report good comfort but their vision seems "a bit off" lately. VA with CLs is slightly reduced. Slit lamp shows significant protein deposits on the lens surfaces. What are your primary concerns and what might you recommend?</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>Answer & Rationale</summary>
                    <p><strong>Primary Concerns:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Reduced Vision:</strong> Likely due to the deposits scattering light and affecting the optical quality of the lens.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lens Deposits:</strong> Indicates potential issues with compliance (not rubbing lenses enough, overwearing), lens material compatibility, or tear film chemistry. Deposits can reduce Dk/t, increase risk of GPC, and decrease comfort over time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Risk of Complications:</strong> Heavy deposits create a surface for bacteria to adhere, increasing infection risk.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <strong>Recommendations:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Review Lens Care Habits:</strong> Specifically ask about their cleaning routine, emphasizing the "rub and rinse" step. Check if they are using compatible solutions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reinforce Lens Replacement Schedule:</strong> Ensure they are replacing lenses monthly as prescribed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider Lens Material Change:</strong> If compliance is good, they might benefit from a lens material more resistant to protein deposition (e.g., a non-ionic material or a different SiHy).</li>
                            <li><strong>Consider Modality Change:</strong> If compliance is an ongoing issue, switching to daily disposables would eliminate care-related deposit problems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Perform a thorough corneal health check</strong> with fluorescein after lens removal to rule out any underlying issues caused by the deposits or reduced oxygen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Update Lens Power</strong> if over-refraction confirms a change is needed after addressing the deposit issue.</li>
                        </ol>

        <h3>Day 7 Summary (Fill this in after your study session!)</h3>
        <p><em>Today covered the challenges of fitting keratoconus, where RGPs are often key due to their ability to mask irregular astigmatism with a tear lens; fitting goals include apical clearance or three-point touch. Lens care is CRITICAL: hand washing, rub & rinse, fresh solution, and case care are paramount to prevent infections like MK. Patient compliance often fails due to misunderstanding or inconvenience, so clear education is vital. Follow-up exams are essential for monitoring health (especially corneal staining with fluorescein after lens removal), lens fit, vision, and reinforcing good habits. For example, if a KC patient has a very steep cone, a fitting philosophy aiming for... would be appropriate. A key strategy to improve patient compliance is...</em></p>
