            <h2>Step 29: Follow-up Slit Lamp Examination with Contact Lenses (Lens ON eye)</h2>
            <p>This is part of the comprehensive follow-up exam (Step 28), focusing on what you observe while the patient is <span class="key-term">wearing their lenses</span>.</p>
            <h3>Key Assessment Areas (Lens ON):</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lens Fit (Re-assessment):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Soft Lenses:</strong> Confirm good <span class="key-term">Centration, Coverage, and Movement (C,C,M)</span>. Check for edge fluting (loose) or conjunctival indentation/vessel blanching (tight). (Covered in Day 5)</li>
                        <li><strong>RGP Lenses:</strong> Re-assess <span class="key-term">fluorescein pattern</span> (dynamic and static) and lens movement. Check for decentration, excessive bearing, or inadequate edge lift. (Covered in Day 5)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Lens Surface Condition:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Deposits:</strong> Look for protein films (whitish, hazy), lipid globules (greasy), jelly bumps (mucous/calcium), makeup. Use diffuse and focal illumination. <span class="cl-relevance">Deposits reduce comfort, vision, Dk/t, and increase GPC risk.</span></li>
                        <li><strong>Wettability:</strong> Does the tear film spread evenly over the lens surface or break up quickly (hydrophobic spots)? Poor wettability causes dryness and blurry vision.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lens Defects:</strong> Scratches, chips, tears (especially soft lenses), crazing (fine cracks in RGPs). <span class="cl-relevance">Defective lenses must be replaced.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Corneal Health (signs visible with lens on):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Corneal Edema:</strong> Look for vertical <span class="key-term">striae</span> (fine whitish lines in posterior stroma, visible with parallelepiped or optic section if >5-8% edema). Epithelial <span class="key-term">microcysts</span> (small, refractile dots) indicate chronic hypoxia. Sattler's veil (epithelial haze reported by patient).</li>
                        <li><strong>Limbal Hyperemia (Redness):</strong> Assess degree and location. Can indicate tight fit, hypoxia, solution reaction, or inflammation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Neovascularization:</strong> Check limbal area for blood vessel encroachment onto cornea (best seen with lens off, but initial signs may be visible).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tear Film Over Lens:</strong> Assess quality and quantity of pre-lens tear film. Rapid tear break-up time (TBUT) over the lens indicates potential wettability issues or dry eye.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="study-tip">
                <strong>Study Tip - Slit Lamp Routine:</strong> Develop a systematic routine for your slit lamp exam (both lens on and lens off) to ensure you don't miss anything. E.g., Lids -> Conjunctiva -> Lens Surface -> Lens Fit -> Underlying Cornea (as much as visible) -> Limbal Area.
            </div>

            <h2>Step 30: Cosmetic Contact Lenses</h2>
            <p>Lenses worn primarily to change the appearance of the eye color or look.</p>
            <h3>Types:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="key-term">Opaque Lenses:</span> Have a non-transparent colored pattern to completely change eye color (e.g., brown to blue). Have a clear central pupil.</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Enhancer Tints / Handling Tints:</span> Translucent tint to enhance existing eye color or make lenses easier to see for handling (usually very light blue/green). Do not significantly change eye color.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Motivations for Wear:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fashion, novelty, matching outfits, special occasions.</li>
                <li>Theatrical or character portrayal.</li>
                <li>Prosthetic use (to mask corneal scars or iris abnormalities - these are often custom).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Fitting Considerations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proper Fit is ESSENTIAL:</strong> Even though "cosmetic," they are still medical devices. All standard fitting principles apply (Centration, Coverage, Movement).</li>
                <li><strong>Pupil Size Matching:</strong> The clear optic zone of an opaque lens must be large enough to cover the patient's pupil in various lighting conditions to avoid vision being obscured by the colored part.</li>
                <li><strong>Centration:</strong> Critical for opaque lenses. If the lens decenters, the colored iris pattern may not align with the patient's natural iris, or the clear pupil zone may not cover the patient's pupil, leading to an unnatural look and/or visual obstruction.</li>
                <li><strong>Color/Pattern Selection:</strong> Subjective. Patient preference is key, but ECP can advise on what looks natural.</li>
                <li><strong>Material & Dk/t:</strong> Many cosmetic lenses are older hydrogel materials with lower Dk/t. The pigments can also reduce oxygen transmission. <span class="cl-relevance">Counsel on appropriate wear times to minimize hypoxia.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <div class="important-warning">
                <strong>Risks of Improperly Fitted/Illegal Cosmetic Lenses:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Corneal abrasions, infections (Microbial Keratitis), hypoxia, allergic reactions.</li>
                    <li>Often sold illegally online or in novelty stores without a prescription or proper fitting.</li>
                    <li>Public health concern due to high rates of complications with illegally sold lenses.</li>
                    <li><span class="key-term">Educate patients that ALL contact lenses, including cosmetic ones, are medical devices requiring a prescription and professional fitting.</span></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Step 31: Fitting Contact Lenses in Children</h2>
            <p>Requires special considerations for indications, patient/parent cooperation, and lens selection.</p>
            <h3>Common Indications:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Optical Correction:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Congenital/Pediatric Aphakia:</span> Following cataract surgery. CLs are vital for visual development.</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">High Anisometropia:</span> Significant difference in Rx between eyes. CLs minimize aniseikonia.</li>
                        <li>High Myopia/Hyperopia.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Myopia Control:</span> A rapidly growing indication. Specialized soft multifocal or orthokeratology lenses to slow myopia progression.</li>
                <li>Amblyopia Treatment (sometimes as part of occlusion therapy or penalization).</li>
                <li>Therapeutic (e.g., bandage lens after trauma).</li>
                <li>Cosmetic/Prosthetic (e.g., aniridia, albinism).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Considerations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> No strict age limit. Depends on child's maturity, motivation, and parental support. Infants can be fitted for aphakia.</li>
                <li><span class="key-term">Parental Involvement & Motivation:</span> CRUCIAL. Parents are often responsible for I&R and care, especially in younger children. They must be committed and competent.</li>
                <li><strong>Child's Motivation & Cooperation:</strong> Older children need to want to wear lenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Lens Selection:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Daily Disposables:</span> Often ideal for hygiene, convenience, reduced risk of solution sensitivities or deposit issues. Good for intermittent wear or sports.</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">Silicone Hydrogels:</span> Preferred for higher oxygen if frequent replacement or extended wear (for aphakia) is needed.</li>
                        <li><span class="key-term">RGPs:</span> Excellent optics, durable. Often used for aphakia, keratoconus, or high astigmatism in children.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Handling Challenges:</strong> Smaller eyes, smaller palpebral apertures, fear/anxiety. Requires patience, positive reinforcement, specialized techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Often more frequent than for adults, especially initially, to monitor compliance, ocular health, and refractive changes (children's Rx can change quickly).</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Age-appropriate language for the child, detailed explanations for parents.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="analogy">
                <strong>Analogy - Fitting Children:</strong> Like being a pediatric dentist. You need technical skill, but also excellent "chair-side manner" for both the child and the parents, plus a lot of patience and encouragement.
            </div>

            <h2>Step 32: Toric Contact Lenses (Soft & RGP)</h2>
            <p>Used to correct significant astigmatism that cannot be adequately managed with spherical lenses (typically when <span class="key-term">Residual Astigmatism with a spherical lens is >0.75 D - 1.00 D</span>).</p>
            <h3>Soft Toric Contact Lenses:</h3>
            <div class="toric-stabilization">
            <strong>Key Challenge: Rotational Stability.</strong> A soft toric lens must orient consistently on the eye for the cylindrical correction to be effective. If it rotates, vision becomes blurry.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stabilization Methods:</strong>
                    <ul>

                <p><strong>Toric Scenario:</strong> A patient has a spectacle Rx of -2.00 / -2.50 x 090. K-readings are 42.00 @ 180 / 42.50 @ 090 (0.50D WTR corneal astigmatism). You fit a spherical soft lens and the over-refraction shows -0.25 / -2.25 x 090.
                <br>1. Why is vision likely poor with the spherical soft lens?
                <br>2. What type of contact lens would be most appropriate next?

                <details>
                    <summary>Answer & Rationale</summary>
                    <p>1. Vision is poor because the spherical soft lens does not correct the astigmatism. The residual astigmatism is -2.25 D, which is very significant. The spectacle cylinder is -2.50 D, and the cornea only has 0.50 D of astigmatism. This means most of the astigmatism (~2.00 D) is <span class="key-term">internal/lenticular</span>.
                    <br>2. The most appropriate next lens would be a <span class="key-term">Soft Toric Contact Lens</span>. A spherical RGP would correct the 0.50 D of corneal astigmatism but would leave approximately -2.00 D of internal astigmatism uncorrected. A Front Surface Toric (FST) RGP could also be an option if the patient preferred RGPs, as it's designed for low corneal astigmatism with significant internal astigmatism.

        <h3>Day 8 Summary (Fill this in after your study session!)</h3>
        <p><em>Today, I learned that follow-up slit lamp exams (lens on) focus on fit, surface deposits/wettability, and subtle signs of corneal stress. Cosmetic lenses, while for appearance, are medical devices needing proper fitting to avoid risks like hypoxia, especially considering pupil coverage. Fitting children requires high parental involvement, age-appropriate lens choices (like daily disposables), and patience. Toric lenses are for significant astigmatism; soft torics use methods like dynamic stabilization (and LARS for OR), while RGP torics (FST, BST, Bitoric) address different combinations of corneal and internal astigmatism. For example, if a soft toric lens mark is rotated 10 degrees to my left (patient's right) and the spectacle axis is 180, the compensated axis would be...
